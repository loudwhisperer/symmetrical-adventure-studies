## Description
Horiseon Solutions website beta eventually will be final product pending testing. It was lacking in
common accessibility standards and proper semantic HTML qualities so I went ahead and changed those aspects as well 
deeming the hero, which was a background image initially better off as an element on the index.HTML file and as an added benefit it also has a alt attribute now. I certainly learned not everything can be committed to semantic
element as changing a few divs around gave me some trouble with pushing elements where I didn't want them. Now its
more accessible and SEO friendly.
